Welcome to this repository, where I'm excited to share my very first project with you! It's a Pharmacy Management System created using C# and SQL Server. I developed this project between 2017-2018 as my graduating project at an IT institute.

The main goal of sharing this project is to provide a helpful resource specifically for beginners in programming. Feel free to explore the repository, take a look at the code, and use it as a valuable learning tool.

Remember, simplicity is key to understanding and progress, so embrace this project as a starting point to develop your skills and broaden your horizons in the world of software development.
